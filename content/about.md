🙋🏽 Hello I am Jacqueline Binya. I am a software developer and blogger 
I created this blog to document all things Javascript and also to geek off about tech (Yipee! 💃🏽).

👩🏾‍💻 I am mainly a frontend developer, I code in Vue and React. I am fascinated by the sheer power of these frameworks in enabling developers to write clean, reusable code and how they make is so easy to test and maintain code. Yes I love testing 💪🏾

🦄 I am a self-taught developer and BootCamp Graduate. I was fortunate to attend one of the few coding BootCamps in Africa!! I graduated from a 2 week Andela BootCamp in Kigali, Rwanda in September 2019 where I specialized in full-stack web development.

🦋 I was introduced to community events way back in 2019 by a fellow developer and friend after I had finished my BootCamp. I was so eager to continue the culture of meeting up with other developers so as to share information and to network in general. So I went on the organize the first Hackctoberfest Event ever in my city Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. From then onward I have become quite the tech butterfly I make it a point to attend all community events as I possible can. I also volunteer to speak at tech events and I am especially passionate about helping & encouraging newbie developers to grow and develop their skills. In addition to that I am also zealous about advocating for web accessibility. 
I also recently started contributing to free and open-source software, I am hoping to also share my experiences in that regard.

🧘🏾‍♀️ During weekends you will most likely find me spending time with my son, taking nature walks or baking treats in the kitchen.
