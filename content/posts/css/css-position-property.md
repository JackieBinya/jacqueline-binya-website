By default all elements in a document are arranged in a single flat plane. The CSS position property allows us to create and position elements in multi level planes which are positioned relative to the default plane.
The CSS position property can have the following values: static, absolute, relative, fixed and sticky.

## CSS ``position: static``
- The the CSS ``position:static`` value describes the default position of elements in the browser i.e. they exist in a single flat plane.

## CSS ``position: absolute``
- The the CSS ``position:absolute`` value describes the default position of elements in the browser i.e. they exist in a single flat plane.

## CSS ``position: relative``
- The the CSS ``position:relative`` value describes the default position of elements in the browser i.e. they exist in a single flat plane.

## CSS ``position: fixed``
- The the CSS ``position:fixed`` value describes the default position of elements in the browser i.e. they exist in a single flat plane.

## CSS ``position: sticky``
- The the CSS ``position:sticky`` value describes the default position of elements in the browser i.e. they exist in a single flat plane.
