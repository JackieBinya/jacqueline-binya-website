Since my introduction to the git workflow. I have resolved my own fair share of conflicts. Admittedly when I started using git, conflicts were frustrating and upsetting occurrence mainly because I didn't understand why and how they occurred. 

Unwittingly I actually thought they were something I could avoid, I thought there was a way I could outsmart git, hahaha! The word conflict has a negative connotation to it so don't blame my newbie response. 
I remember during my BootCamp at Andela, we worked in such a way that you could only merge your pull request to the main develop branch if it had been reviewed and then approved.
So my genius way of ensuring I totally avoided conflicts, was to wait and have my PRs approved and consequently merged to the develop branch one at a time and that impacted negatively on my overall output. 
The reason I feared conflicts was the first time I was ever brave enough to queue up my PRs I made a giant mess trying to resolve the conflicts and lost all my work. 

Anyways all the previous tutorials I had followed up to that point had only covered _git clone, pull and push_, I honestly didn't know we made war in git! 

In this series, I document my steps in re-creating and hopefully resolving my favorite conflicts.

## Keywords

* HEAD: normally the HEAD pointer, points to the latest commit on a branch you have currently checked out.
* History: Git works by compiling information about details of commits of individual branches if you run the command ```git log ``` you get the history of a branch you have currently checked out.
Then _git log --oneline_ prints each commit on a single line, which is useful if youâ€™re looking at a lot of commits.

## Creating the conflict

To get started I created a repo on github initialized it with a README.md and cloned it on my machine.

Then on VS code, I opened 
Using the command, ```git checkout -b create-bio``` I branched off *master* and created a branch called *create-bio* and then checked out *create-bio*.  
_create-bio_ is normally referred to as a feature branch. Its good practice to open a branch for every feature than work on your _master_. This ensures you only merge to _master_ the code that works and your work is clean.

After that I then created a file called _bio.txt_ and added a simple unimaginative line of code to it:

A git environment can be broken down into two distinct parts. The remote repository is where you push the code you want to share with others which in my case is hosted by Github and your development environment. The development environment consists of the working directory, staging area, and local repository. So basically when using git workflow, when you clone your repo from the remote it comes with a .git folder. That folder is basically the local repository. 
In essence, Git is a clever piece of software that not only ensures that you can track your files it also allows you to share them as well. Under the hood, git works by persisting branches and commits.
The working directory is just that, the stuff you work on. So as you work you have to naturally keep track of the files you are working on and to do that you add them to the staging area. 

So to track _bio.txt_. I add it to the staging area by running the command, ```git add .```

Using the command, ```git commit -m "Adds bio.txt"```
I add _bio.txt_ to my local repository it's official, the changes I was tracking have been committed to my local repo.

Remember when I started off I cloned my remote repository and it only had the _master_ branch now that I've created a new branch in my local. The local and the remote are out of sync so using the command, ```git push --set-upstream origin create-bio```
I create the branch _create-bio_ in the origin/remote and simultaneously push the changes in that branch to the remote repo.

So far all things are fine and dandy, to introduce some chaos I then edit the file _bio.txt_ ever so slightly,

If u run the command, ```git status```
You will see that the _bio.txt_ has been modified. So to add the changes I made to _bio.txt_ to the staging area I run the command ```git add .```

This time to add my staged changes to my local I use the command, ```git commit --amend --no-edit```
The command above allows me to combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating an entirely new commit. This git views as an entirely new commit, history has been re-written.

To verify that history has been altered, if I log my git history on the terminal, although the commit message is the same for the tip of the branch before and after running the command _git commit --amend --no-edit_ the commit hashes (i.e. the string that precedes the commit message) are different as shown below:
```
f780b5d (HEAD -> create-bio, origin/create-bio) Adds bio.txt
7619836 (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) Initial commit
PS C:\Users\\Desktop\git-tut-1> git commit --amend --no-edit
[create-bio 1b61b25] Adds bio.txt
 Date: Thu Oct 10 03:30:45 2019 +0200
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 bio.txt
PS C:\Users\\Desktop\git-tut-1> git log --oneline
1b61b25 (HEAD -> create-bio) Adds bio.txt
7619836 (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) Initial commit
```
If you run the command, ```git status```
The message you get on the terminal is:
```
On branch create-bio
Your branch and 'origin/create-bio' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
```

I then attempt to sync my remote to my local, by running the command,```git push```
On the terminal I get the error: 
![Screenshot of code block](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/eklp6fkudekdyka7m4zo.png)

As advised in the error message, I then run the command, ```git pull```
And voila the message on the terminal reads:
```
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in bio.txt
Auto-merging bio.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
The conflict on VS Code:

## Resolving the Conflict

Using VS Code editor it's very easy to resolve the conflict I simply choose to _Accept Current Change_, this option allows me to keep the changes in the HEAD.
You can then play around with the other options to explore how they work. Just ensure when you are done resolving the conflict your code looks normal as in you have gotten rid of the arrows, commit hash, and equal signs.

I then run the command,  ```git add .``` 
To add changes to the staging area, then proceed to commit them by running the command ```git commit -m "Resolved"``` After which I run the command: ```git push```

So my local and remote are in sync.
