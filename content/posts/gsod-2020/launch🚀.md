_This is a draft silly_

My name is Jacqueline Binya. I am a software developer and technical writer from Zimbabwe. I am going to write a series of blog posts documenting my experience and lessons as I  contribute to the <a class="article-link" href=""> Creative Commons WordPress Base Theme </a> during the  <a class="article-link" href="">Google Season of Docs</a> 2020 (GSOD-2020) as a technical writer.

## What is Google Season of Docs?

The Google Season of the Docs initiative was born out of a need to improve the quality of open-source documentation as well as to advocate for open source, documentation, and technical writing. Annually during the GSOD, technical writers are invited to contribute to  OS projects through a highly intensive process at geared ensuring that technical writers and the projects they contribute too during GSOD are a good fit after that has been determined GSOD then resumes.

## My intentions and thought process applying for GSOD 2020 
I learned about GSOD through tech Twitter and my reasons for applying to GSOD were mainly influenced by the reasons listed below:

### The power of good documentation
 that having been a techie fro a reasonable amount of time I have used various software, programming languages and frameworks and one thing you learn to appreciate is the power  of good documentation, Good documentation  makes software usable that also warranties inclusivity. I would like to believe that I am a champion of inclusivity.

### Growth 
my skill as a technical writer I have been blogging 
Pick up a new skill
Improve my communication skills as a techie - written communication is as valid as verbal communication especially now when most people are working remotely.
