Use effect hook allows us to perform side effects in function-based React components. The term _side effects_ describes the interactions of the react app with external APIs e.g. DOM( Document Object Model ) i.e DOM traversal and/or manipulation and the retrieval of data from APIs.

## Using the Use Effect Hook in function-based React components.

The use effect hook is shipped into react as a named export. Hence to access it in a component.

Syntactically the use effect hook is a function which takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is sometimes referred too as the _effect_.

By default _useEffect()_ runs after each re-render, but it can be customized to run under specified conditions. As shown below:

## useContext hook
Nested hierachy components
To address issue of passing data descendant components
One may use _props_, flux libraries like Redux or MobX or simply use hooks.

`useContext` creates context at the top level of related components, by that it simply configures a data object which is accessible to all components within the heirachal structure.
